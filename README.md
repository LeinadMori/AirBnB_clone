Building an Airbnb project using Python involves various aspects, including data management, user interface development, and database connectivity.

Project Description:

A command interpreter (CLI) is a program that allows users to interact with a computer by entering commands through a text interface. It provides a structured way to execute commands, automate tasks, and control the system.

Command Interpreter Description:

This command interpreter provides a basic interface for executing user-specified commands. It takes commands from the user, parses them, and executes the corresponding actions. The interpreter supports a range of built-in commands for basic operations, such as file management, directory navigation, and program execution

Command Interpreter Description:
This command interpreter provides a basic interface for executing user-specified commands. It takes commands from the user, parses them, and executes the corresponding actions. The interpreter supports a range of built-in commands for basic operations, such as file management, directory navigation, and program execution.

Starting the Command Interpreter:
To start the command interpreter, you can either launch it from the command line or integrate it into an existing program. If you're using the command line, simply type the name of the interpreter program. For instance, if the interpreter is named python , you would type script_name.py in the command prompt.

Using the Command Interpreter:
Once the interpreter is running, you can enter commands directly into the text interface. Each command typically consists of a keyword followed by options and argumentFor example, to list the contents of the current directory, you would type ls. To change to a different directory, you would type cd directory_name.

Examples:

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

List directory contents: ls

Present working directory: pwd

Change directory: cd directory_name

Create a new directory: mkdir directory_name

Remove a directory: rmdir directory_name

Get system information: uname -a

Print current date and time: date

Execute a program: program_name arguments..
